# mdci

* Will eventually be merged with [mdc-instagram](https://github.com/codeforamerica/mdc-instagram)
* replicates a lot of functionality found on [Litterati](http://www.litterati.org/)

## Dependencies

* Leaflet.js: [Get your keys.](http://leafletjs.com)
* Instagram API access: [Get yours.](http://instagram.com/developers)
* Sorcery for user managemet: [Sorcery](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery)

## Installation

I'll flesh this out, but as far as Sorcery goes, I used [this tutorial](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/wiki/Simple-Password-Authentication).

## Why?

Litterati collects images from Instagram tagged with #litterati and displays them in a grid. This collects images from Instagram tagged with a hashtag defined in the Admin panel, and displays it on a map with the center defined by the Admin. The idea is to collect visual data associated with a given hashtag in a given geolocation. In Miami, use cases include king tides, flooding, and other rising-sea-level problems. 

Prompted by an ask from someone at Miami-Dade County, so it'd be nice to eventually hand this off as a thing that anyone could roll on their own server.
